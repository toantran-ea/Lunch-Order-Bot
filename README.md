# Lunch-Order-Bot
An attempt to over-engineer to get my lunch book properly 

[BEAUTIFUL and MEANINGLESS QUOTE with pic goes here]

This bot helps me catch the order lunch email sent from HR to order lunch for next week every Friday (or Thursday)

Once it receives the email, it will parse the email and find for the Google Sheet URL and helps order lunch for me based on the most
favourite dished ordered by my colleagues.

How the sheet looks like:

It will re-run and udpate the order several times till Saturday morning and send me result via Slack message.
